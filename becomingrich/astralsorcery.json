  "Astral sorcery, once you get into the attunement section, can create rituals which can convert stone into ore passively using starlight. In order to perform the cerimony, you need to attune either a rock crystal or celestial crystal to the Mineralis constellation and place it atop a ritual pedistal.",
  {"underline": true,
    "No blocks or any elements can be placed within the ring created by the marble brick or the ritual will not activate!"},
  "You can tell that the ritual is active by the ring surrounding it at night, and the fact that it is throwing off one or more beams of refracted star light. This ritual is normally a fairly slow process, but it can be sped up by aiming a collector crystal or two at the pedestal, and placing mirrors at the ends of the refracted light and using them to focus the light back in on the pedestal itself.",
  "Over time, the crystal in the ritual pedistal will be worn down and, if not treated, will eventually break. This can be counteracted by letting the crystal soak in a pool of liquid starlight to rebuild it's size.",
